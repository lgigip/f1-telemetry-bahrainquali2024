# F1 Telemetry Analysis - <span style="color:#1E90FF">Verstappen</span> vs <span style="color:#FF8700">Piastri</span> (Bahrain GP Qualifying 2024)
This project compares the fastest laps of **<span style="color:#1E90FF">Max Verstappen</span>** and **<span style="color:#FF8700">Oscar Piastri</span>** during the **2024 Bahrain Grand Prix Qualifying Session**, using the *FastF1 Python Library*.

With the aim to develop abilties in **motorsport data analysis and visualisation**, this project extracts and compares F1 data, to explore correlations between performance and driving technique. 

#### 1. Speed Comparison


### 2. Throttle and Brake Comparison
This plot, an overlay of throttle and brake application across the drivers' fastest laps, visualises the differences in braking points and throttle commitment, providing insight into driver style.

## Motivation Behind the Project
In alignment with my interest in performance engineering and motorsport technology, and in pursuit of a career in motorsport, this was built as an independent passion project. 
This exploration of **real-world motorsport telemetry and performance data** provides the chance to demonstrate **practical application of software and data analysis**.

## Future Adaptations
- Expand comparison to multiple laps
- Integrate tyre/weather data for further data analysis
