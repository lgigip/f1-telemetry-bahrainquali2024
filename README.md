# F1 Telemetry Analysis - Verstappen vs Piastri (Bahrain GP Qualifying 2024)
This project compares the fastest laps of **Max Verstappen**ðŸ”µ and **Oscar Piastri**ðŸŸ  during the **2024 Bahrain Grand Prix Qualifying Session**, using the *FastF1 Python Library*.

With the aim to develop abilties in **motorsport data analysis and visualisation**, this project extracts and compares F1 data, to explore correlations between performance and driving technique.

#### Plot 1 - Speed Comparison
This comparison of speeds across each driver's fastest lap reveals differences in braking efficiency, acceleration out of corners, and driving consistency. Visualising the data collected across these laps offers insight into potential setup variations and overall driving style. The plot shows Verstappen reaches higher terminal speeds during the main straight of his fastest lap, suggesting McLaren's setup compromise favouring cornering over straight-line speed.

#### Plot 2 - Throttle and Brake Comparison
This plot, an overlay of throttle and brake application across the drivers' fastest laps, visualises the differences in braking points and throttle commitment. The overlay highlights Piastri's slightly earlier braking and more cautious throttle modulation, compared to Verstappen's. Whilst Piastri's traces get progressively smoother, demonstrating a careful and controlled approach, Verstappen's consistently smooth traces indicate confidence and experience with the car.







**In conclusion**, Verstappen demonstrates less hesitation, with slightly later and harder braking into major corners, whilst Piastri brakes earlier and with smoother modulation. Overall, the visualised data illustrates Piastri's slightly more conservative driving style, trading pace for a more controlled lap. This project uncovered the subtle variations in driving style and confidence of Max VerstappenðŸ”µ and Oscar PiastriðŸŸ , despite both laps being closely matched overall.

### Motivation Behind the Project
In alignment with my interest in performance engineering and motorsport technology, and in pursuit of a career in motorsport, this was built as an independent passion project. 
This exploration of **real-world motorsport telemetry and performance data** provides the chance to demonstrate **practical application of software and data analysis**.

### Future Adaptations
- Expand comparison to multiple laps
- Integrate tyre/weather data for further data analysis
