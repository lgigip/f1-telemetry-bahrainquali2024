# F1 Telemetry Analysis - Verstappen vs Piastri (Bahrain GP Qualifying 2024)
#
With the aim to develop abilties in **motorsport data analysis and visualisation**, I built this project to extract and compare F1 data; exploring correlations between performance and driving technique. 
#
This project compares the fastest laps of **Max Verstappen**ðŸ”µ and **Oscar Piastri**ðŸŸ  during the **2024 Bahrain Grand Prix Qualifying Session**, using the *FastF1 Python Library*.
#
#### Plot 1 - Speed Comparison
This plot visualises the speed comparison across each driver's fastest lap, revealing differences in braking efficiency, acceleration out of corners, and driving consistency. Visualising the data collected across these laps offers insight into potential setup variations and overall driving style. The plot shows Verstappen reaches higher terminal speeds during the main straight of his fastest lap, suggesting McLaren's setup compromise favouring cornering over straight-line speed.
#
#### Plot 2 - Throttle and Brake Comparison
This plot, an overlay of throttle and brake application across the drivers' fastest laps, visualises the differences in braking points and throttle commitment. The overlay highlights Piastri's slightly earlier braking and more cautious throttle modulation, compared to Verstappen's. Whilst Piastri's traces get progressively smoother, demonstrating a careful and controlled approach, Verstappen's consistently smooth traces indicate confidence and experience with the car.
#
**In conclusion**, Verstappen demonstrates less hesitation, with slightly later and harder braking into major corners, whilst Piastri brakes earlier and with smoother modulation. Overall, the visualised data illustrates Piastri's slightly more conservative driving style, trading pace for a more controlled lap. Despite both drivers' fastest laps being closely matched overall, this project uncovered the subtle variations in Verstappen and Piastri's confidence and driving style.
#
#### Future Adaptations
- Expand comparison to multiple laps (not solely the drivers' fastest laps)
- Integrate tyre/weather data for further data analysis
#
#### Motivation Behind the Project
This was built as an independent passion project; an exploration of **real-world motorsport telemetry and performance data** that demonstrates **practical application of software and data analysis** and my interest in performance engineering and motorsport technology.
